# FivemCodeAI

🚀 **FivemCodeAI** is a free, AI-powered assistant designed for **FiveM developers** using frameworks like **QBCore**, **ESX**, and **QBX**.

This tool helps you save time by generating code, debugging Lua scripts, building NUI UIs, analyzing errors, and more – all through a simple web interface.

🧪 Still in early stages – you may encounter occasional bugs, but overall it works well.
